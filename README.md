# Nasa API

> A Java SpringBoot project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install your API
From your IDE you can just run the program as an SpringBoot app and select 'NasaApiApplication.java' if asked.

# The application will be served at localhost:8080/nasa/temperature

# Build an executable JAR
You can run the application from the command line with Maven.

If you use Maven, you can run the application by using ./mvnw spring-boot:run. 
Alternatively, you can build the JAR file with ./mvnw clean package and then run the JAR file, as follows:

java -jar target/nasa-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
